# TournamentValorant

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.8.

## Development server

To run the application, install the dependencies using the command "npm i."

Then, simply execute "npm run start," which will run the commands "json-server --watch src/db.json & ng serve."

Alternatively, you can instantiate them separately by running "json-server --watch src/db.json" in one terminal and "ng serve" in another.

Json-server is a "mini" REST API that enables data mocking and simulates the application in use.

### About

The application allows the user to add 8 teams and experience a dynamic tournament bracket.

As the challenge is set in Valoran, I found it appropriate to use the color palette and typography from League of Legends (although I prefer lighter tones usually).
